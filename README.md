Techdegree Project 4: OOP Game Show App

In this project I used what I learned in previous courses about the DOM and event listeners
along with new knowledge with objects including properties, methods, constructors, and even different
ways to iterate over arrays with objects. My game does what it's meant to do and will reset at the very end
to start a new game. Thanks!
